# CodeAlpha_Student-Grade-Tracker-
The **Student Grade Tracker**, a Java console app, manages student grades. Users add students with validated names and grades (0-100), stored in an ArrayList. A menu-driven interface offers a summary report with grades, average, highest/lowest grades with names, and student count. It exits cleanly, handling invalid inputs.
